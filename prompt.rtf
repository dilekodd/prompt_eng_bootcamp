\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 As a frontend developer, your task is to create a website using HTML and Bootstrap framework, utilizing CSS and JavaScript via CDN. The website must be mobile-responsive and include the latest Twitter Bootstrap CSS classes for styling. The final output should be a single HTML file containing a navigation menu with internal links to headings within the page content. No code explanations should be provided. Do you understand these requirements? Please respond with yes or no.\

You should add four sections of content to this page, each containing an H2 tag to start the section, and after that, you should add several paragraph tags containing text related to Turkish cuisine. These four sections are as follows: (meats, pastries, desserts, and drinks). Also, include an image of Turkish cuisine, along with a caption that explains what the image is. This image should float to the right side of the page and have a maximum width of 450 px.\
